This is a skeleton Unreal project folder for the VRSecretary demo.

Steps:
1. Copy engine-plugins/unreal/VRSecretary into this project's Plugins/ folder.
2. Download scifi_girl_v.01.glb as described in assets/avatars/scifi_girl_v01/README.md.
3. Import the GLB into Content/Characters/ScifiGirl.
4. Create BP_SecretaryAvatar using that mesh and hook it to UVRSecretaryComponent events.
